 "mindset": "Custom `TextDecrypt` component: I designed a lightweight animation that reveals letters one by one. Goal: bring some dynamism to the page while keeping the component reusable and performant.",
  "developer": "Same animation logic with `TextDecrypt`, but designed to remain fully responsive with adaptive text sizes (sm, lg).",
  "projectsButton": "CSS-only animated button with a scrolling text effect. No unnecessary JavaScript → smooth and performant.",
  "contactButton": "Accessibility-focused button: hover and focus states meet WCAG AA contrast standards and are fully keyboard-accessible.",
  "layout": "Responsive layout built with Flexbox and Tailwind breakpoints. Two clear columns on desktop, simplified stacked layout on mobile.",
  "resumeData": "All data related to my resume is externalized in `resume.json`. This separates content from presentation and makes it reusable elsewhere."
